Ok, so now that we have a taste for how Arms works, let's talk about the variations in talents we have available. Venthyr arms is very straight forwards in its builds, with two main rows which change between Raiding and Dungeons, but the play style doesn't alter much between them, allowing for an overall consistent rotation regardless of the content you're doing. The two main builds can be categorized as Single Target vs Multi-Target and look like this at a glance:

<img class="size-full" src="https://hrothmar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Venthyr-Arms-Warrior-talents-9.0.5.jpg" alt="A chart on the left shows which talents to take for raiding while a chart on the right shows which talents to choose for dungeons." width="1200" height="399" />

## Tier 1 (level 15): Skullsplitter
This row boils down to a choice of *Performance vs Ease of Use*. If you want to do the best possible damage, go with **Skullsplitter** for its on-demand Rage generation which helps ensure consistent Rage the fight. Alternatively, *Sudden Death* will randomly give us free use of **Condemn**, usable at any HP range, but is not taken by any of the top performing Venthyr Arms Warriors currently due do its inconsistent chance to occur. That said, *Sudden Death* is a completely OK option *if you want a more passive talent* and do not want to manage **Skullsplitter**.

## Tier 2 (level 25): Double Time or Storm Bolt
For raiding, we'll be taking *Double Time* in all content since it gives us more rage generation and fall damage prevention. For dungeons, **Storm Bolt** will be the go-to option in most situations unless your team is extremely crowd-control-heavy already.

## Tier 3 (level 30): Massacre
In all content, Venthyr warriors will be taking Massacre because it results in more **Condemn** casts. This talent allows us to use **Condemn** starting at 35% HP instead of 20% HP, which is a tremendous DPS increase- out performing all other options in this row.

It does NOT affect the opening execute window (from 100%-80%), for clarity.

## Tier 4 (level 35): Situational
This is a utility row and each of these talents is good in the right circumstance.

- **Second Wind** is a good option where you do not need to worry about positioning or damage mitigation, it can be nice in some dungeons like Plaguefall, but is generally less taken.</li>
- **Bounding Stride** is great if you're not worried about survivability, giving us the option to relocate more frequently, making this is our default Raid choice. The reduced cooldown on our leap helps significantly with fights with Artificer Xy'mox, whose Annihilation ability can be entirely ignored since your **Heroic Leap** will be available for every single cast.</li>
- **Defensive Stance** is extremely powerful, giving us on-demand damage mitigation with infinite duration at the cost of doing lower damage while active, making it our go-to dungeon choice.</li>

## Tier 5 (level 40): Warbreaker
Overall, **Warbreaker** is currently the best choice in this tier for all content. It replaces **Colossus Smash**, does the same amount of damage, has half the cooldown, and hits all targets in range instead of just the main target. The cooldown reduction allows **Warbreaker** to line up perfectly with other cooldowns, making it an easy and comfortable pick for all content.

## Tier 7 (level 50): Dreadnaught or Ravager
For single target fights we'll be choosing the **Ravager** talent. **Ravager** replaces **Bladestorm** with a much weaker damage output comparatively, but it is a placeable, remote **Bladestorm** instead. The reason we take **Ravager** is because it is a non-channeled ability (whereas **Bladestorm** requires you to channel)– meaning we can continue casting other abilities while **Ravager** occurs. **Ravager** is amazing for single target fights due to its interplay with our legendary (it still procs Signet of Tormented Kings),  **Ravager** allows us to continue using **Condemn** while it goes off, and **Ravager** passively generates a fair amount of Rage.

As for multi-target, we'll be taking *Dreadnaught*, which gives us two stacks of **Overpower** and causes **Overpower** to also deal a wave of damage on up to 5 targets in front of you. When combined with **Sweeping Strikes**, Dreadnaught will cause not one, but TWO frontal cones of damage, dealing significant multi-target damage. Taking the Dreadnaught talent also allows us to keep **Bladestorm**, which is better than **Ravager** in multi-target situations.

### Additional Powers
Now that we've covered the abilities and talents, it's time to look at the preferred [Legendary, Soulbind, and Conduits guide](https://hrothmar.com/guides/venthyr-arms-warrior-legendary-soulbinds-conduits-guide) to give our Warriors a bit more power under the hood before we set them loose upon the world (of warcraft).
