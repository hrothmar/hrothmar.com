Hey friends! This is a shorter guide, but I wanted to create a shareable, quick-reference graphic for the 10.0 Dragonflight Prepatch event, which allows you <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-bosses-invade-azeroth-on-wows-18th-anniversary-ilvl-272-loot-drops-329763?webhook#worldbosses-azuregos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a chance at ilvl 272 gear</a> (including some appearances which were previously removed from the game). These lockouts areÂ <em>daily</em>, but the boss changes every day as well. There is 4 world bosses total and 3 of them are static (available every single day), while the 4th, the "Dragon of Nightmare" is on a daily rotating Schedule.

<strong>Static World Bosses (does not change daily):</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=167749/doomwalker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doomwalker</a> (outside the Caverns of Time, Kalmindor)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=12397/lord-kazzak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lord Kazzak</a> (The Blasted Lands, Eastern Kingdom)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=6109/azuregos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azuregos</a> (Azshara, Kalimdor)</li>
</ul>
<strong>"Dragon of Nightmare" world boss (changes daily):</strong>
