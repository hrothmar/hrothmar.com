<h2>Legendary Gear</h2>
<strong>Runecarving Memory:</strong> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=183381/memory-of-the-tormented-kings">Signet of Tormented Kings</a>
<strong>Gear Slot:</strong> Ideally on a Ring, but Wrists is option as well
<strong>Ideal Stats:</strong> Critical Strike + Haste

Venthyr Arms currently has one worthwhile legendary, the<em> Signet of Tormented Kings</em>. This power causes the following effect:
<blockquote>Activating <span class="q9"><strong>Ravager</strong>, </span><strong>Bladestorm</strong>, <strong>Recklessness</strong>, or <strong>Avatar</strong> randomly casts one of the other two abilities at reduced effectiveness.</blockquote>
This legendary causes casts of your major DPS Arms Cooldowns (<strong>Avatar</strong> or <strong>Ravager/Bladestorm</strong>) to then cause an additional, different major cooldown at a lowered duration. An interesting benefit from this legendary is that it allows Arms to gain the major DPS cooldown of the Fury Warrior specialization as well, "<strong>Recklessness</strong>", which gives 100% increased rage generation and +20% critical strike chance. So by casting <strong>Avatar</strong> or <strong>Ravager/Bladestorm</strong>, you will randomly get <strong>Avatar</strong>, <strong>Ravager/Bladestorm</strong>, or <strong>Recklessness</strong> as well (double, free buffs!). If you already have one of these buffs up, it will either add to the existing duration, or in the case of Ravager it will just spawn a second one for a shorter duration. It's a very passive legendary, with minimal impact on your rotation for large power gain.

<h2>Soulbinds</h2>
<strong>Best Soulbind</strong>: Nadjia the Mistblade

Your default choice will be to choose <em>Nadjia the Mistblade</em> as your Soulbind for all content. They offer two strong skills as part of their soulbind tree, <strong>Thrill Seeker</strong> which gives you a large haste buff every 1.5min-ish, as well as <strong>Dauntless Duelist</strong>, which is a flat 3% damage buff to the first target you hit in combat– making it great for raiding.

For dungeon situations you'll swap Nadjia’s final conduit path to take <strong>Familiar Predicaments</strong> slot instead of <strong>Dauntless Duelist</strong>. The rationale here is that <strong>Familiar Predicaments</strong> itself is not that great, but it allows you to take a second Potency conduit, which is better for dungeons.

<h2>Conduits</h2>
<strong>Best Potency Conduits:</strong> Ashen Juggernaut &gt; Crash the Ramparts
<strong>Best Finesse Conduits:</strong> Inspiring Presence &gt; Safeguard
<strong>Best Endurance Conduit:</strong> Stalwart Guardian

As for conduits, you'll want to ensure you always take <strong>Ashen Juggernaut</strong> as your first potency conduit since this is your strongest damaging conduit across the board. If you choose a second potency conduit slot (such as for dungeons), you'll want to pick <strong>Crash the Ramparts</strong>, which buffs the damage your <strong>Overpower</strong> does significantly. For Finesse conduits go with <strong>Inspiring Presence</strong> to make your <strong>Rallying Cry</strong> stronger, as well as <strong>Safeguard</strong> which makes your intervene act as an external damage cooldown you can put on friendly targets. For Endurance conduits you'll be taking <strong>Stalwart Guardian</strong> to reduce the cooldown of your major defensive ability, <strong>Die by the Sword</strong>, by a significant amount.

<em>If you do not have access to all of these conduits or conduit-slots yet, be sure to leverage tools like Raidbots.com to see what is best for you with your current options.</em>
