Hey friends! This is a shorter guide, but I wanted to create a shareable, quick-reference graphic for the 10.0 Dragonflight Prepatch event, which allows you [a chance at ilvl 272 gear](https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-bosses-invade-azeroth-on-wows-18th-anniversary-ilvl-272-loot-drops-329763?webhook#worldbosses-azuregos) (including some appearances which were previously removed from the game). These lockouts areÂ <em>daily</em>, but the boss changes every day as well. There is 4 world bosses total and 3 of them are static (available every single day), while the 4th, the "Dragon of Nightmare" is on a daily rotating Schedule.

**Static World Bosses (does not change daily):**

- [Azuregos](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=6109/azuregos) (Azshara, Kalimdor)
- [Doomwalker](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=167749/doomwalker) (outside the Caverns of Time, Kalimdor)
- [Lord Kazzak](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=12397/lord-kazzak) (The Blasted Lands, Eastern Kingdom)

**"Dragon of Nightmare" world boss (changes daily):**

Good luck out there and I can't wait to see each of you in Dragonflight!
