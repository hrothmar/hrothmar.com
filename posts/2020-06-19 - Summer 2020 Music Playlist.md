This summer has seen a lot less crop-tops and fun with friends than anyone was expecting, and the playlist for the season reflects that. I've had the privilege to continue working from home this summer and in my current role I do a fair amount of writing and customer communication. Something I've recently noticed is that I need music that isn't focused on lyrics when writing and this playlist is an extension of what I've been listening to. It features music from as far back as 2003 (Bent's "<em>Moonbeams</em>" off their<em> The Everlasting Blink</em> album) to more recent singles from this month. I hope that it's able to provide you with at least one song that you'll be able to fold into your own playlists &lt;3 Keep wearing your masks, and keep your chins up as much as we can right now.
